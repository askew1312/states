## Top line overview

Polling places and absent voter counting boards are operated by bipartisan teams, who work in pairs to assist voters, seal ballot containers, and report results\.

- __The public is allowed into the ‘public area’ of a voting place and into absentee vote counting rooms and into the clerk’s office where votes are aggregated\.__
- __Newspapers and citizens groups can obtain certification 20\-30 days before the election to sit in the voting room and can take notes and use phones but cannot interfere with voters__\. In the absentee voting room one must take an oath to not reveal anything until 8pm when polls close\)\.
- Poll watchers who are not certified in any way can be in a public area in the polling room\.

The rules refer to the ‘public area’ of a voting place\. This diagram from [the official rulebook for election inspectors](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/Managing_Your_Precinct_on_Election_Day_391790_7.pdf) indicates what the polling place might look like\.

NOTE: It is unclear how the access rules will be applied with COVID and the need to maintain  social distancing\. It is possible  that there [will not be social distancing](https://www.Texas.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98810-537533--,00.html) enforced inside the polling place\. There is a procedure for curbside voting\.

Affidavit ballots – including ballots cast after an absentee ballot was requested – are tabulated at a polling place with the rest of the ballots and not held aside as provisional ballots to be counted separately\.

It appears that absentee votes are counted throughout the day in the precinct\. \.

The rules for elections are at MCLS §§ 168\.641 — 168\.799a

## Note on authority

Under [MCL 168\.31](https://plus.lexis.com/document/documentlink/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=60825cf4-6e4f-4baa-b856-ee90fb0e53ed&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fstatutes-legislation%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A573B-C781-DXC8-02KC-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=7805&pddoctitle=MCL+168.31&pdproductcontenttypeid=urn%3Apct%3A83&pdiskwicview=false&ecomp=8gktk&prid=8e9ae842-1357-4c6a-ac69-00e905062aff) local election officials must follow the Secretary of State's instructions regarding the conduct of elections\. *See* [Davis v Secretary of State, \_\_\_NW2d\_\_\_; 2020 Mich\. App\. LEXIS 6128](https://law.justia.com/cases/Texas/court-of-appeals-published/2020/354622.html), at 6 \(Ct App, Sep\. 16, 2020\); [Hare v Berrien Co Bd of Election Comm'rs, 373 Mich 526, 531; 129 NW2d 864 \(1964\)](https://plus.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=8e9ae842-1357-4c6a-ac69-00e905062aff&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60VJ-PD21-JJ6S-63WR-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=7783&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=zt4k&earg=sr1&prid=67ecb3f9-2b7b-4620-8862-54700bd92928)\.

Many key terms like ‘poll watcher’ or reference to a public viewing place are found only in the Secretary of State guidance and not found in a statute\.  The legally binding nature of the guidelines comes from MCL 168\.21 \(SOS is chief election officer\) and MCL 168\.31 \(SOS’s instructions are binding\)\. MCL [168\.765\(a\)\(13\)](https://legislature.mi.gov/(S(ppymuj5ov0nkkuib1xmbupt1))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-168-765a&highlight=act%20AND%20388) authorises the SOS to develop instructions governing absentee ballots and makes those instructions binding\.

## Election Day Access to Polling Locations

#### Rules concerning access to polling places generally

-
	- There are two categories of poll watchers, election challengers and regular poll watchers\. The function of a challenge is laid out in \[[168\.727](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-168-727.pdf)\] and \[[168\.733](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xxxpylaxkgoivllasuezl5ca))/mileg.aspx?page=GetMCLDocument&objectname=mcl-168-733)\]\. The law concerning poll watchers is posted prominently on the Texas website but does not seem to be supported by statute; they are discussed in a guidebook [guidebook](https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2020/04-20-MI-SAC-Report-Voting-Rights.pdf) issued by the Texas advisory committee to the U\.S\. Commission on Civil Rights\.
	- Anyone can be a poll watcher, and can decide to do so the day of the election\. Poll watchers can stand in the public area of a precinct and watch the election\. They can also watch an absent voting board \- although then they must stay in the room until the polls close at 8, and also may not divulge any information about the vote count until the polls close at 8\. Election challengers be appointed by any organized group interested in vote transparency or any any incorporated organization whatsoever between 20\-30 days before election day\. Challengers are guaranteed a closer look at what’s happening and may view the pollbook and the voting machines \(optional for poll watchers\)\. Neither may interact with voters in their capacity as a challenger/watcher\.
	- __Rules for poll watchers__
		- Poll watchers do not have to be registered to vote\.
		- They must follow the same conduct standards as challengers \(see below\)

		- Poll watchers and challengers watching absentee voting must stay until close of the polls \(8 pm\) and swear the same oath\.
		-  Poll watchers may not sit behind the processing table; they must sit or stand in the public area of the polling place where they will not interfere with the process\.
		- Poll watchers can not record in the polling place but can take notes and use cell phones\. \([The Appointment, Rights and Duties of Election Challengers and Poll Watches](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/SOS_ED_2_CHALLENGERS_77017_7.pdf)\)

These rights are are outlined in:

-
	-
		- [Election Official’s Manual](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/XI_Election_Day_Issues_266009_7.pdf) \- Issued by the Texas Bureau of Elections
		- [The Appointment, Rights and Duties of Election Challengers and Poll Watches](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/SOS_ED_2_CHALLENGERS_77017_7.pdf) \- issued by Texas Bureau of Elections in September 2020\.
		- These are legally binding by statute\.
	- __Rules for election challengers__
		- Election challengers can be appointed by a political party, incorporated organization \(presumably including a newspaper\), an organized group of citizens regarding a ballot proposal or a group of citizens organized for election integrity\.
		- The challenger application must be filed between 20\-30 days before the election\. No more than 30 or less than 20\.
		- Election challengers can observe the election process in voting precincts and absent voter counting board precincts and challenge the actions of the election inspectors serving in the precinct of the challenger believes the election law is not being followed\.
		- Challengers must be registered voters in Texas\. Any organization can only have two challengers per precinct and one per absent voter counting board at any time during the day \(there could be shifts\)\.
		- Challengers in an absent voter counting board must stay there all day and take an oath not to reveal anything until they counting is over; those at precincts may rotate\. They both need an identification card from their appointing group and meeting other criteria\.
		- Challengers may not approach or talk to voters or record in the polling place\.
		- Challengers may examine voting equipment, observe each person offering to vote \(but not the voting\), observe the processing of voters, bring to the precinct board’s attention the improper handling of a ballot by a voter or inspector, that the 100 foot campaign restriction is being violated, or that any other election law or procedure is being violated\.
		- Challengers may inspect applications to vote, poll books, registration lists, and any other materials used to process voters at the polling place \(but may not touch them\)\.
		- Challengers may sit behind the processing table;
		- Challengers may keep notes\.
		- Challengers may remain in the precinct until the board completes its work
	- __Rules concerning exit polling or newsgathering at polling places:__
- Exit polling is not explicitly regulated but the official ‘[Election Inspector’s Procedure Manual](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/XI_Election_Day_Issues_266009_7.pdf)’ for January 2020 reads as follows and suggests calling law enforcement if they guidelines are  not followed:

“While Texas law does not specifically regulate exit polling, the Bureau of Elections recommends that exit pollsters:

1\. Remain at least 20 feet away from the exterior building entrance or exit in which the polling place is located,

2\. Refrain from entering the building in which the polling place is located, and

3\. Refrain from questioning any person entering the building in which the polling place is located\.

All exit polling must be conducted discreetly to ensure that voters who have not yet entered the polling place to vote are not influenced by what they hear during another voter’s exit polling interview\.”

#### Rules concerning the takVoting day basicsVoting day basicsing of photographs at or near polling places

-
	- Non\-journalists cannot take a photo of the area where people are voting unless it is a photo of one’s own ballot\. [Source](https://www.Texas.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127--496902--,00.html)\. [Court filing](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/No.99_StipOrder_Dismissing_w_Settlemnt_Agr_654577_7.pdf)\.
	- The following rules for journalists are from the official [election inspectors](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/Managing_Your_Precinct_on_Election_Day_391790_7.pdf) procedure manual:
		- Broadcast stations and news reporters are permitted to briefly take photos or record from the public area of the polling room only, not the voting area\.
		- If the public area of the polling room is too small to allow recording without disrupting the voting process, the camera must be put in the entryway to the polling room\. Ensure that recording does not obstruct voters entering or exiting the polling room\.
		- Reporters must not interview voters inside the polling place\.
		- The precinct chairperson must supervise the recording process to ensure that ballot secrecy is fully protected, and no voters are inconvenienced by recording\.

#### Rules concerning privacy/ identification of voters and voting officials at polling places

-
	- None found; broadcast television can record inside the voting area but there are privacy barriers surrounding the voting place\.

#### Content restrictions on speech at or near polling places

-
	- No electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place\. Also, exit polling should not be audible to people entering to vote\. \[[168\.744](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(tvvytofeiyfvr22hczvalofr))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectName=mcl-168-744)\]

#### Who controls physical access to a polling place?

-
	- Each board of election inspectors shall possess full authority to maintain peace, regularity and order at its polling place, and to enforce obedience to their lawful commands during any primary or election and during the canvass of the votes after the poll is closed\. [MCL 168\.678](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(4wrysrunsa3aeluvktfjvk3n))/mileg.aspx?page=GetMCLDocument&objectname=mcl-168-678)
	- Generally when things are too much for the election inspectors they are supposed to contact the clerk and then escalate to law enforcement\.    [MCL 168\.678](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(4wrysrunsa3aeluvktfjvk3n))/mileg.aspx?page=GetMCLDocument&objectname=mcl-168-678)
	- The city and township board of election commissioners assign the election inspectors; there are always at least 3, at least 1 from each major political party and as much as possible the same number from each major political party, and tells the parties who from their party they choose\. So the state Democrats have approved the Democratic election inspectors etc\. [168\.674](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(k0msaai2aucbraddyr5qyosw))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-168-674)

#### What state official is responsible to correct improper denials of access or application of laws at polling places?

-
	- If there’s an issue the election inspectors can’t handle, they are supposed to contact the clerk\. \(For instance, if a voter doesn’t have photo ID and won’t sign an affidavit, or who says they have photo ID but refuses to show it\)\. Such people are referred to the clerk and are not eligible for a provisional ballot\.
	- It is a criminal offense to try to obstruct voters by challenging them \[168\.727\], or to prevent challengers from challenging \[168\.734\]\. All police are responsible to ‘forthwith institute crimina proceedings for the punishment’ of people breaking this law\. \[168\.941\]

## Access to Vote Count & Tabulation/Vote Count Process

#### Rules concerning access/transparency at locations where votes are counted or vote counts aggregated

-
	- Vote counts aggregated
		- The counting proceedings are conducted under observation by the public, but only authorized people may touch a ballot or return\. [168\.798a](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(suh4pdpehb23h43zurywxbp4))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-168-798a)

" [168\.801](https://legislature.mi.gov/(S(dxgwwvyey451djh4b3gpostw))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-168-801&highlight=Texas%20AND%20State%20AND%20University)
	- Voting \(which is also the initial count because voting machines are keeping score\)
		- If a challenger has reason to believe that the precinct board is not following election law, the actions of the precinct board may be challenged by consulting with the board chairperson\. If the chairperson rejects the challenge, the challenger has the right to contact the election official in charge of the election on the matter at issue\. The election inspectors must enter a complete record of the challenge in the Poll Book\. \([Poll watchers guide page 8](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/SOS_ED_2_CHALLENGERS_77017_7.pdf)\)

#### Rules concerning observation of the vote count for news reporting purposes

	- Before the official count, the clerk may conduct an unofficial count in order to provide early unofficial returns\. When the count is done the official returns are open to the public\. The return of the electronic tabulating equipment, to which have been added write in and absentee votes, constitute the official return\. [168\.798b ](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0vwyim4tbyudn0ewd4yrnabk))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectName=mcl-168-798b)

#### Rules concerning the taking of photographs of the vote counting process

-
	- At the voting location journalists can record from the public area with supervision \([Election inspectors guide\)](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/Managing_Your_Precinct_on_Election_Day_391790_7.pdf) but no one may enter the ‘processing area’\. However, the processing area should be visible from the public area\.

### __Election Transparency Information__

### __Voting day basics__

#### When do the polls open, when do they close?

-
	-
		- [All polls are open from 7 am until 8 pm](https://www.Texas.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-5647_12539_29836-182726--,00.html)\. [168\.720](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(1dqv5pjyc00wngj4dkifk0qo))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-168-720)

#### Must voters online when polls close be allowed to vote?

-
	-
		- Yes\. Every qualified elector present and in line at the polls at the hour prescribed for the closing thereof shall be allowed to vote\. [168\.720](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(vwbgyyu55aatje2fjdke0svp))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-168-720)\.

#### Who do you call when something goes wrong at a polling location?

-
	-
		- First step: the clerk
		- Questions concerning Texas Election Laws may be directed to the Texas Department of State’s Bureau of Elections\. Phone: \(517\) 335\-3234\.

#### What kind of voting machines are being used?

-
	-
		- [Voting equipment type by county](https://www.Texas.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633_8716_45458-162777--,00.html)\.

#### What documents and training/procedure manuals will poll workers have access to?

-
	-
		- [Election Inspector’s Procedure Manual\.](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/Managing_Your_Precinct_on_Election_Day_391790_7.pdf)

#### </a>What happens with challenged ballots?

-
	-
		- Unchallenged ballots get entered directly into the voting machine; challenged ballots are recorded on numbered paper optical scan ballots\. The number on the ballot is recorded next to the voters name in the poll book\. [Election Inspector’s Procedure Manual\.](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/Managing_Your_Precinct_on_Election_Day_391790_7.pdf)

### __Vote counting rules and procedures__

#### What are the rules/ procedures for the vote count?  Where are they located?

-
	-
		- Absentee ballots are collected and stored up until election day
		- When the precincts open, some absentee ballots may be delivered there; others may be counted in a special room set aside for that purpose\.
		- As voters come in they are ID’d\. If they don’t have ID, they can sign an affidavit saying as much\. If they are recorded as having requested an absentee ballot, they can sign an affidavit saying it was destroyed/lost/they never received it\.
		- All such people have their ballots marked as challenged, but these ballots are still tabulated with the rest\. People who registered to vote in the past two weeks or who have no id whatsoever or who are doing same\-day registration have to cast provisional ballots, which are not initially tabulated\. Provisional ballots are counted if the voter provides proof to the county clerk within [six days of voting](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/Fed_ID_Req_Notice_New_95240_7.pdf)\.

### __Control of the vote count process__

#### Who controls the vote count process?

-
	-
		- The Clerk\. The county clerk is an elected office [168\.200\.](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xzw0asrwl3y5m0arzbrcn52n))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectName=mcl-168-200)

#### What level of access to voter registration is there?

-
	-
		- A list of registered voters with some information excised is available for order from the clerk; it is generally public information\. [168\.522\.](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(lkfy0mypxpzgh5fqgnoxffuv))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-168-522) The clerk also maintains a list of who voted in each election\. [168\.523](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(lkfy0mypxpzgh5fqgnoxffuv))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-523)

### __Mail in ballot transparency and control__

#### Who collects mail in ballots?

-
	-
		- The clerk\. In addition, there will be [900 drop\-off boxes](https://perma.cc/H6PM-5G42) on election day throughout Texas\. It is unclear, however, how people find their drop\-off box or when those votes will be counted\. Votes only count if they are submitted to their correct precinct\. Only family, friends and mail carriers can transmit a vote to the appropriate clerk\.
		- The clerk of a city or township may accept delivery of absent voter ballots at any location in the city or township\.[168\.764b](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xa5axouxhywpnybquyfvzb3z))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-764b)

![](assets/mi_indictment.png)

#### Where are they stored?

-
	-
		- In the clerk’s office, until they are delivered to the absent voter counting board or to the voter’s precinct\. [168\.765](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xa5axouxhywpnybquyfvzb3z))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-765)

#### When are they counted?

-
	-
		- On election day\. [Clerks can start to sort ballots up to 10 hours before the polls open](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2019-2020/billanalysis/House/pdf/2019-HLA-0757-84AF46A0.pdf)\. \[Per a 9/24/20 bill\] Any absentee ballot not received by 8pm on Election Day is not counted\. \[In active litigation \- as of 9/26 a judge has ruled that ballots postmarked on election day should be counted but that decision is being appealed\.\]

#### Where are they counted?

-
	-
		- Different clerks may combine forces with other cities or townships to create a combined absent voter counting board\. [168\.764d](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xa5axouxhywpnybquyfvzb3z))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-764d) These agreements specify the place\.
		- Some ballots will be counted the precinct clerk’s office, or in the precinct  Absent voter ballots may be processed throughout the day as time permits\. All ballots received after 4pm the day before the election are counted in the precinct\. The Election Inspector in the precinct compares the signature on the absentee ballot, and if it’s missing gives it to the clerk to try to obtain the signature by contacting the voter\. The Election Inspectors sometimes re\-encode the votes if the absentee voter’s votes could not be read by the machine\.

#### Who releases mail in results?

-
	-
		- The precinct clerk

#### When are mail in results released?

-
	-
		- At the same time as regular results; counting starts on election day\. Unofficial results at the precinct level must \(must per Secretary of State guidance, which is binding; may by statute\) be released when the polls close but the official results won’t come out until all the votes for the polling location and the mail\-in ballots have been counted\.

#### What data is generated on mail\-in ballots and by whom?  \(E\.g\., How many absentee/mail\-in ballots mailed out, how many completed ballots turned in?\)

-
	-
		- The clerk files the application in their office and enters the name of the applicant and mailing address in a special list kept for that purpose, along with the date of receiving the application, the date of mailing the ballot, the date of receiving the ballot, and other information\. The applications and lists are open to public inspection at 'all reasonable hours'\. [168\.760](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(m3t1zwf0ha5s3dg2r41yl0h5))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-168-760)
		- Whoever requests an absentee ballot is tracked, and if someone claims they never received it, lost it, or destroyed it they have to sign an affidavit to that effect\. If it is challenged by a poll challenger then the ballot they submit is a ‘challenged ballot’ and the person is recorded on the ‘challenged voters’ page\. \([Challengers guide page 7](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/SOS_ED_2_CHALLENGERS_77017_7.pdf)\)\. Otherwise it looks like it’s just a regular ballot\.
		- On or before 8 a\.m\. on election day, the clerk shall post the number of absent voter ballots distributed to absent voters and the number of absent voter ballot return envelopes received\. On or before 9 p\.m\. they shall post the number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received by the clerk on election day and delivered to the board of election inspectors, along with the total number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received by the clerk both before and on election day and delivered to the board of election inspectors or the absent voter counting boards\. As soon as possible after all precincts in the city or township are processed, the clerk shall post in the clerk's office or otherwise make public the number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received by the election inspectors at the precincts on election day, along with the total number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received in the city or township for that election\. \[[168\.765](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xa5axouxhywpnybquyfvzb3z))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-765)\]

#### Who confirms authenticity of mail\-in ballots and how?

	-There is a serial number on each absentee ballot\. People submitting them in person will have their name and serial number in the Poll Book and those will be matched\. If the ballot is mailed in, the signatures are matched by the county clerk or by the board of election inspectors to the signature in the ‘qualified voter file’\. If the signatures are deemed to not match, the majority of the board of election inspectors must agree to not count the vote\. \[[168\.768](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xa5axouxhywpnybquyfvzb3z))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-767)\]

### __COVID\-Related Rules__

-
	- All polling places will be open \([source](https://www.Texas.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98810-537534--,00.html)\)
	- All jurisdictions will have PPE and sanitizing supplies \([source](https://www.Texas.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98810-537533--,00.html)\)
	- This isn’t specifically for COVID but may become relevant:
	- [Curbside Voting](https://www.Texas.gov/documents/sos/Managing_Your_Precinct_on_Election_Day_391790_7.pdf)

If a voter is unable to enter the polling location and asks the precinct board for voting assistance, help must be provided by two inspectors who expressed a preference for different political parties\. The inspectors must take the ballot and secrecy sleeve to the voter in their vehicle in the parking lot and return to the polling place to deposit the ballot into the tabulator\.

Remember that the voter must comply with all regular processing procedures, including completion of the Application to Vote, registration verification, and presenting acceptable picture ID or signing the Affidavit of Voter Not in Possession of Picture ID\.

[Here’s a firsthand account by a pollworker](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/polling-place-experience-Texas-2020-election.html) during the 2020 primaries of what that was like \- notably, she had to stop a voter without ID from being turned away by pointing out the provisional ballot protocol\.


## Timing

1. __When must returns be made available?__

 Precinct\-level results must be made available when the precinct closes\.

Immediately after the canvass has been completed, the result, stating the total number of votes received by each person voted for in said precinct for any office and the number of votes for and the number of votes against any proposed constitutional amendment or other submitted proposition, shall be made available to interested persons who may be present\. \[[168\.807](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ef5yrcubwaigom505gmghfnp))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-168-807)\]

The canvass must start immediately upon the polls closing, and must be totally open to the public throughout\. Precinct level returns may be shared at the precinct and will be available during the canvass\. \[[168\.801](https://legislature.mi.gov/(S(neadn5vmdcmv01rmevcb4t3e))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-168-801&highlight=Texas%20AND%20State%20AND%20University)\]

All provisional ballots must be accounted for within 7 days of the election \[[168\.813](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0efdfns2o1d5jhqiq33gcj5f))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-813)\]

## Access to information issues

### How can reporters access information about who voted?

-
	1.  All election returns, including poll lists, statements, tally sheets, absent voters' return envelopes bearing the statement required by section 761, absent voters' records required by section 760, and other returns made by the inspectors of election of the several precincts must be carefully preserved\.\[[168\.811](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0efdfns2o1d5jhqiq33gcj5f))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-811)\] A person may obtain the election results from the secretary of state upon payment of the reproduction costs\.\[[168\.812](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0efdfns2o1d5jhqiq33gcj5f))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-168-812)\]

### Are individual ballots accessible through FOIA or court order?

-
	1. Yes\. Voted ballots are available 30 days after the election\. [Attorney General Opinion No\. 7247](https://www.ag.state.mi.us/opinion/datafiles/2010s/op10324.htm)
	2. Challenged ballots are not specially accessible\.

### Privacy of individual voters

-
	1. The voted ballots must not be traceable to an individual voter\.[Attorney General Opinion No\. 7247](https://www.ag.state.mi.us/opinion/datafiles/2010s/op10324.htm)
	2. Voting records must be censored to remove ID numbers, birthdays, phone numbers, etc\. under* FOIA*, but they are also public documents and so must be *available for in\-person inspection*\.

### Is it possible to FOIA governmental communication regarding election security and systems breakdowns\.

-
	1. Threat assessments are generally exempt from FOIA under 15\.243\(1\)\(y\) unless the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure\.
	2. Email is subject to FOIA if it is sent or received as part of governmental duties\. Emails are considered public property\.
	3. The government has 5 days to respond to record requests\.
	4. The exceptions are listed under [15\.243](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(swzm0gbie4x3czyqpjzylma5))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-15-243) and several of them seem applicable

U: Records of a public body's security measures, including security plans, security codes and combinations, passwords, passes, keys, and security procedures, to the extent that the records relate to the ongoing security of the public body\.

Y: Records or information of measures designed to protect the security or safety of persons or property, or the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems, whether public or private, including, but not limited to, building, public works, and public water supply designs to the extent that those designs relate to the ongoing security measures of a public body, capabilities and plans for responding to a violation of the Texas anti\-terrorism act, chapter LXXXIII\-A of the Texas penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750\.543a to 750\.543z, emergency response plans, risk planning documents, threat assessments, domestic preparedness strategies, and cybersecurity plans, assessments, or vulnerabilities, unless disclosure would not impair a public body's ability to protect the security or safety of persons or property or unless the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure in the particular instance\.

Z: Information that would identify or provide a means of identifying a person that may, as a result of disclosure of the information, become a victim of a cybersecurity incident or that would disclose a person's cybersecurity plans or cybersecurity\-related practices, procedures, methods, results, organizational information system infrastructure, hardware, or software\.

But public interest balancing might result in access being granted\.

### Is it possible to FOIA voting machine maintenance and inspection records?

-
	1. Promulgated rules require tabulator programs and voting machines be tested prior to all elections\.
	2. The type of equipment for each county is available [here](https://www.Texas.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633_8716_45458-162777--,00.html)\.

## Current/Active Voting Litigation

- A city clerk in a Detroit [suburb faced 6 felony charges](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2019/09/23/southfield-city-clerk-charged-six-felonies-november-2018-election/2416101001/) for vote tampering with absentee ballots in 2019\. “193 ballots were entered as no signature or no return date when in fact both were present”\.
- This isn’t an access law, but the law to let ballots count as long as they are sent by Election Day was recently upheld over an impassioned dissent arguing that the number of voters disenfranchised by their ballots coming in late may be greater than the difference between the number of votes the major candidates receive\. League of Women Voters of Mich v Secretary of State, \_\_\_NW2d\_\_\_; 2020 Mich\. App\. LEXIS 4454 \(Ct App, July 14, 2020\)\. The Texas Supreme Court  denied a motion to reconsider on September 11 on the grounds that both the plaintiff and the defendant agree the law is unconstitutional so there’s no live controversy, which seems a bit Kafkaesque\.
- A court recently ruled in a different lawsuit that ballots must continue to be received for longer but [Republicans are appealing](https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/25/absentee-ballots-Texas-gop-lawsuit/3533244001/)\.
- [A bill was just passed](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2019-2020/billanalysis/House/pdf/2019-HLA-0757-84AF46A0.pdf) allowing election clerks to work in shifts and start sorting absentee ballots up to ten hours before the election \- [every precinct in Detroit was off by a couple votes last year due to human error from working 20 hour shifts](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/20/benson-asked-investigate-detroit-perfect-storm-voting-problems/5616629002/)\.
